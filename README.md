# UART Verification Project using UVM 
## This project implements the Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART) protocol verification using the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) in SystemVerilog. The testbench is designed to verify the functionality of a UART Design Under Test (DUT) through a modular and reusable UVM-based environment.
